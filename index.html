       <h2 class="title">Valentines Is Coming Soon</h2>
       <p class="message">I Edward Karapetyan have a very serious question to ask you...<br> as you can hopefully tell from the title and probably from the date that a very special occasion is coming up. Even though were already together it's usually expected from the boyfriend that he asks his girlfriend if she would wanna be his valentine again but I kinda wanted to do something different </p>
       <p class="message">I thought that instead of just relying on the fact that you would wanna be my valentine in the first place I thought I'd try and convince you just in case</p>
       <h3 class="title1"><b>REASON 1: I AM RELATED TO MBAPPÉ</b></h3>
       <img class="mbabe" src="images/Mbabe.jpg">
       <p class="reason1answer"> Most people don't actually know this about me but I am actually related to world famous soccer/football player Kylian Mbappé. You can even tell by the photo shown above that I look IDENTICAL to him in every single way down to the smile :) <br>(I also am very good at soccer which I attribute to Mr. Mbappé)</p>
       <h3 class="title2"><b>REASON 2: I AM A FAMILY MAN</b></h3>
       <img class="godfather" src="images/Godfather.jpg"> 
       <p class="reason2answer">Do I even have to explain this one... just look at this picture of me like Im legit a Godfather. I was actually chosen to be a Godfather not once but TWICE. My dream is also to be an amazing father for my two future children and an amazing husband for my amazing wife</p>
       <h3 class="title3"><b>REASON 3: I AM A TERRIFIC SINGER</b></h3>
       <img class="hospital" src="images/Hospital.jpg">
       <p class="reason3answer">This photo actually has a very deep story behind it. It all started when famous musician Kanye West (we don't talk about the controversies) asked me to make a cover for one of his songs which was planned to be on his latest album. I know you're probably dying to hear it and trust me you will but I digress. I was singing with so much passion in the car that I lost control of the car and the next thing I know I wake up in the hospital hence the photo.</p>
       <h3 class="title4"><b>REASON 4: I LOVE YOU</b></h3>
       <img class="hat" src="images/hat2.png">
       <p class="reason4answer">I know I know after these reasons it's pretty hard to say yes BUT all jokes aside there is nothing in this world that I would want more than for me to be able to call you my valentine this year. Our second year together is approaching and trust me when I say that this last full year with you has been filled with nothing but happiness and joy. I also hope you like the flower bear I thought it's pretty cute. </p>
